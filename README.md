# KiversalPrototypeGame
This is a second version prototype similar to Juego de Ganso. However it is made in Unity, since Godot had problems properlly playing the audio quick enough.
I had a lot less time to work on this version compared to Juego de Ganso. So if wanting to see a display of my work look at Juego de Ganso. Kiversal Prototype Game is a 2d infinte side scroller. With the objective of getting as high of a score as possible. It uses prerendered tilemaps to randomly generate selected paths for the player. Using a similar system to subway surfer and other large games in the genre. This means that Kiversal Prototype Game is easily customizable and more levels could be added in the future. I am very fond of the city scape that I created and enjoy how it infinetly builds. Credit all assets were taken from the unity asset store demos.

# Purpose
The game was made expressly for the purpose of intergrating with kiversal medical equipment. Kiversal is a medtech company specializing in audiometery devices. KiversalPrototypeGame is designed to sync with these medical devices. Kiversal is designing a medical device for all ages. Children at a very young age before having learned language can sometimes be very hard to test. Which is why an aid when administering hearing tests to young children can be necessary. This is where KiversalPrototypeGame comes in, it is designed to be a game to help create sound triggers that can be synced with medical equipment to make it easier to test young children. Currently it can run on any computer and android device. There are no forseeable plans to add the game to iOS. I was unable to fully complete the connectivity before I had to begin working on other projects.
